She and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark are miraculously still alive. Katniss should be relieved, happy even. After all, she has returned to her family and her longtime friend, Gale. Yet nothing is the way Katniss wishes it to be. Gale holds her at an icy distance. Peeta has turned his back on her completely. And there are whispers of a rebellion against the Capitol - a rebellion that Katniss and Peeta may have helped create.<br /><br />Much to her shock, Katniss has fueled an unrest she's afraid she cannot stop. And what scares her even more is that she's not entirely convinced she should try. As time draws near for Katniss and Peeta to visit the districts on the Capitol's cruel Victory Tour, the stakes are higher than ever. If they can't prove, without a shadow of a doubt, that they are lost in their love for each other, the consequences will be horrifying.<br /><br />In <i>Catching Fire</i>, the second novel in the Hunger Games trilogy, Suzanne Collins continues the story of Katniss Everdeen, testing her more than ever before...and surprising readers at every turn.",

Early in its history, a rebellion led by a 13th district against the Capitol resulted in its destruction and the creation of an annual televised event known as the Hunger Games. In punishment, and as a reminder of the power and grace of the Capitol, each district must yield one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 through a lottery system to participate in the games. The 'tributes' are chosen during the annual Reaping and are forced to fight to the death, leaving only one survivor to claim victory.<br /><br />When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives, some of whom have trained for this their whole lives. , she sees it as a death sentence. But Katniss has been close to death before. For her, survival is second nature.",

Worse, the only one who can understand what Chey has become is the manâor wolfâwho's doomed her to this fate. He also wants to chop her head off with an axe. <br /><br />Yet as the line between human and beast blurs, so too does the distinction between hunter and hunted . . . for Chey is more than just the victim she appears to be. But once she's within killing range, she may find thatâeven for a werewolfâit's not always easy to go for the jugular.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>",

Now the scope widens and the intensity deepens as the epic story surges forward with <i>The Twelve</i>.<br /><br />In the present day, as the man-made apocalypse unfolds, three strangers navigate the chaos. Lila, a doctor and an expectant mother, is so shattered by the spread of violence and infection that she continues to plan for her childâs arrival even as society dissolves around her. Kittridge, known to the world as âLast Stand in Denver,â has been forced to flee his stronghold and is now on the road, dodging the infected, armed but alone and well aware that a tank of gas will get him only so far. April is a teenager fighting to guide her little brother safely through a landscape of death and ruin. These three will learn that they have not been fully abandonedâand that in connection lies hope, even on the darkest of nights.<br /><br />One hundred years in the future, Amy and the others fight on for humankindâs salvation...unaware that the rules have changed. The enemy has evolved, and a dark new order has arisen with a vision of the future infinitely more horrifying than manâs extinction. If the Twelve are to fall, one of those united to vanquish them will have to pay the ultimate price.",

And <i>The Mystic Arts of Erasing All Signs of Death</i> is the type of storyâswift, twisted, hilarious, somehow hopefulâthat only he could dream up.<br /><br />The fact is, whether itâs a dog hit by a train or an old lady who had a heart attack on the can, someone has to clean up the nasty mess. And that someone is Webster Fillmore Goodhue, who just may be the least likely person in Los Angeles County to hold down such a gig. With his teaching career derailed by tragedy, Web hasnât done much for the last year except some heavy slacking. But when his only friend in the world lets him know that his freeloading days are over, and he tires of taking cash from his spaced-out mom and refuses to take any more from his embittered father, Web joins Clean Teamâand soon finds himself sponging a Malibu suicideâs brains from a bathroom mirror, and flirting with the manâs bereaved and beautiful daughter.<br /><br />Then things get weird: The dead manâs daughter asks a favor. Her brotherâs in need of somebody who can clean up a mess. Every cell in Webâs brain tells him to turn her down, but something elseÂ makes him hit the Harbor Freeway at midnight to help her however he can. Is it her laugh? Her desperate tone of voice? TheÂ chance that this mightÂ beÂ historyâs strangest booty call?Â Whatever it is, soon enough itâs Web who needs the help when gun-toting California cowboys start showing up on his doorstep. Whatâs the deal? Is it something to do with what he cleaned up in that motel room in Carson? Or is it all about the brewing war between rival trauma cleaners? Web doesnât have a clue, but heâll need to get one if heâs going to keep from getting his face kicked in. Again. And again. And again.<br /><br />Full of black humor, stunning violence, singular characters, and neon dialogue, <i>The Mystic Arts of Erasing All Signs of Death</i> is classic Charlie Huston: a wild ride thatâll leave you breathless and shaken, grinning and begging for more.",

Gripping, unnerving, exhilarating, and haunting, Sleepless is well worth staying up for.<br /><br />What former philosophy student Parker Hass wanted was a better world. A world both just and safe for his wife and infant daughter. So he joined the LAPD and tried to make it that way. But the world changed. Struck by waves of chaos carried in on a tide of insomnia. A plague of sleeplessness.<br /><br />Park can sleep, but he is wide awake. And as much as he wishes he was dreaming, his eyes are open. He has no choice but to see it all. That's his job. Working undercover as a drug dealer in a Los Angeles ruled in equal parts by martial law and insurgency, he's tasked with cutting off illegal trade in Dreamer, the only drug that can give the infected what they most crave: sleep.<br /><br />After a year of lost leads and false trails, Park stumbles into the perilous shadows cast by the pharmaceuticals giant behind Dreamer. Somewhere in those shadows, at the nexus of disease and drugs and money, a secret is hiding. Drawn into the inner circle of a tech guru with a warped agenda and a special use for the sleepless themselves, Park thinks he knows what that secret might be.<br />Â <br />To know for certain, he will have to go deeper into the restless world. His wife has become sleepless, and their daughter may soon share the same fate. For them, he will risk what they need most from him: his belief that justice <br />must be served. Unknown to him, his choice ties all of their futures to the singularly deadly nature of an aging mercenary who stalks Park.<br /><br />The deeper Park stumbles through the dark, the more he is convinced that it is obscuring the real world. Bring enough light and the shadows will retreat. Bring enough light and everyone will see themselves again. Bring enough light and he will find his way to the safe corner, the harbor he's promised his family. Whatever the cost to himself.<br /><br />It is July 2010.<br /><br />The future is coming.<br /><br />Open your eyes.",

After exposing the secret source of blood for half of Manhattanâs Vampyres, heâs definitely a dead man walking. Heâs been a punching bag and a bullet magnet for every Vampyre Clan in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx, not to mention a private eye, an enforcer, an exile, and a vigilante, but now heâs just a target with legs.<br /><br />For a year heâs sloshed around the subway tunnels and sewers, tapping the veins of the lost, while above ground a Vampyre civil war threatens to drag the Clans into the sunlight once and for all. Whatâs it gonna take to dig him up? Just the search for a missing girl whoâs carrying a baby that just might be the destiny of Vampyre-kind. Not that Joe cares all that much about destiny and such. What he cares about is that his ex-girl Evie wants him to take the gig. Whatâs the risk? Another turn playing pigeon in a shooting gallery. Whatâs the reward? Maybe one shot of his own. Whatâs he aiming for? Nothing much. Just all the evil at the heart of his world.",

Justinia Malvern, the worldâs oldest living vampire, has taken up residence, and her strength grows by the moment as she raids the inmate population like an open bar with an all-you-can-drink supply of fresh blood. The crafty old vampire knows just how to pull Caxtonâs strings, too, and she's issued an ultimatum that Laura canât refuse. <br /><br />Now Laura has just 23 hours to fight her way through a gauntlet of vampires, cons, and killers . . . 23 hours to make one last, desperate attempt at protecting the world from Justiniaâs evil. <i>\n<br /></i>",

        "desc": "Alongside William Gibson and Neal Stephenson, Bruce Sterling stands at the forefront of a select group of writers whose pitch-perfect grasp of the cultural and scientific zeitgeist endows their works of speculative near-future fiction with uncanny verisimilitude. To read a novel by Sterling is to receive a dispatch from a time traveler. Now, with <b>The Caryatids</b>, Sterling has written a stunning testament of faith in the power of human intellect, creativity, and spirit to overcome any obstacleâeven the obstacles we carry inside ourselves. <br /><br />The world of 2060 is divided into three spheres of influence, each fighting with the others over the resources of fallen nations and an environment degraded almost to the point of no return. There is the Dispensation, centered in Los Angeles, where entertainment and capitalism have fused with the highest of high-tech. There is the Acquis, a Green-centered collective that uses invasive neurological technology to create a networked utopia. And there is China, the sole surviving nation-state, a dinosaur that has prospered only by pitilessly pruning its own population. Products of this monstrous world, the daughters of a monstrous mother, andâaccording to someâmonsters themselves, are the Caryatids: the four surviving female clones of a mad Balkan genius and wanted war criminal now ensconced, safely beyond extradition, on an orbiting space station. Radmila is a Dispensation star determined to forget her past by building a glittering, impregnable future. Vera is an Acquis functionary dedicated to reclaiming their home, the Croatian island of Mljet, from catastrophic pollution. Sonja is a medical specialist in China renowned for selflessly risking herself to help others. And Biserka is a one-woman terrorist network. The four âsistersâ are united only by their hatred for their âmotherââand for one another. <br /><br />When evidence surfaces of a coming environmental cataclysm, the Dispensation sends its greatest statesmanâor salesmanâJohn Montgomery Montalban, husband of Radmila, and lover of Vera and Sonja, to gather the Caryatids together in an audacious plan to save the world.",

But even more important, she has to prevent him from becoming a beast exponentially more dangerous - a Vampire Zero.<br /><br />The author of <i>13 Bullets</i> and <i>99 Coffins</i>, David Wellington takes the Laura Caxton series to a whole new level in this action-packed third volume.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />(Description from back cover of trade paperback edition)",

The horror of what the vampires did is too close, the wounds too fresh. But when Jameson Arkeley, broken and barely recognizable, comes to her with an unfathomable, unholy discovery, her resolve crumbles.<br /><br />Arkeley leads Caxton to a tomb in Gettysburg recently excavated by a local archaeology professor. While the town, with its legendary role in the Civil Warâs worst battle, is no stranger to cemeteries, this one is remarkably, eerily different. In it lie 100 coffinsâ99 of them occupied by vampires, who, luckily, are missing their hearts. But one of the coffins is empty and smashed to pieces.<br /><br />Who is the missing vampire? Does he have access to the 99 hearts that, if placed back in the bodies of their owners, could reanimate an entire bloodthirsty army? How did the vampires end up there, undisturbed and undiscovered for 150 years? The answer lies in Civil War documents that contain sinister secrets about the newly found coffinsâsecrets that Laura Caxton is about to uncover as she is thrown into a deadly, gruesome mission of saving an entire town from a mass invasion of the undeadâ¦",

But the evidence proves otherwise.<br /><br />When a state trooper named Caxton calls the FBI looking for help in the middle of the night, it is Arkeley who gets the assignment - who else? He's been expecting such a call to come eventually. Sure, it has been years since any signs of an attack, but Arkeley knows what most people don't: there is one left. In an abandoned asylum she is rotting, plotting, and biding her time in a way that only the undead can.<br /><br />Caxton is out of her league on this case and more than a little afraid, but the fed made it plain that there is only one way out. But the worst thing is the feeling that the vampires want more than just her blood. They want her for a reason, one she can't guess; a reason her sphinxlike partner knows but won't say; a reason she has to find out - or die trying.<br /><br />Now there are only 13 bullets between Caxton and Arkeley and the vampires. There are only 13 bullets between us, the living, and them, the damned.",

Oceans of blood, scattered limbs, wanton violence, and general mayhem abound, along with revivified mummies, a Welsh sorcerer, and Wellington's signature brand of cool high-tech weaponry and sly humor â zombies, after all, are the ultimate consumers. What do the undead want, aside from fresh meat? Do the steadily diminishing number of humans who have somehow managed to survive over a decade of living hell stand a chance on a planet where they've been reduced to the status of prey? It all ends here, on Monster Planet.",
